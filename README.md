## Project: Python bootcamp learning platform.

#### Overview : A simplified simulation mimicking a backend system where an admin updates and modifies the system manually. To be automated at a later stage.

- Terminate the program.
- Add students to the database. 
- List all students registered in the database.
- Update students' progress.
- Search for students and view their progress.
- Get statistics about the courses.


#### Usage:
 Explain to the user how to use your project:

 - type in 0 to terminate the program.
 - type in 1 to add a student to the database.
 - type in 2 to list all students registered in the database.
 - type in 3 to update students' progress. 
 - type in 4 to search for students and view their progress.
 - type in 5 to get statistics about the courses.
